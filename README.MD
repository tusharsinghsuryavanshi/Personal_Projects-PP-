# Transforming Data with Python

This folder contains files created/used for the guided project at www.dataquest.io. The focus of this exercise is to write scripts that import functions from other python files and then run them on the command line.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### hn_stories.csv
##### This is the csv file we'll be working with
### read.py
##### This script contains the function to read the csv and assign it to a dataframe and then add column names to the csv file 
### count.py
##### This script seperates each word in the strings of the csv file abd prints the most common 100 words and the number of times they appear in the dataframe
### domains.py
##### This script prints the 100 most submitted domains
### times.py
##### This script uses dateutil.parser to return a datetime object from the timestamp and returns the number of occurences of each hour.
